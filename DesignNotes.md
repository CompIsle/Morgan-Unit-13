I Wanted to Make the webpage as appealing as posssible, by addding NavBar's, Scrollwhells and othetr familier items that the user/consumer would find on other webpgaes. 

I also added infomation about deals and offers, such as the alert at the top near the navbar, videos like the Google Pixel embeded video. I wanted to combine familiarity and original new infomation, the reason I added deals and offers was to hook the person in and saying, "Oh a Deal, well i might have a look." It's a marketing technique of deals/offers.
It was a challange making a Mobile Phone site as there were many things consider, looks, ease of use, security and accsess. I ran the website in multiple diffrent  websites, and from the results below you can see when it worked and when it didn't. 
This was my first website fully complete and i considered every possible for design choices, I spent ages redesigning the Wireframes as there was many options but I went with the simplist. The others were messy and over-comlicated, i went with simple clean and easy to understand. It needed to be obvious that we (NewVision Mobile) had more to offer than meets the eye.

Simple, Clean and Easy to use were my 3 main concerns when going into creating webpage. It was a challage but yet I confronted it, my wireframes went through may changes as well as the actual webpage, there was origanlly a Data Plans tab I worked on during "Work From Home" But i scrapped it early on, it was messy, complicated and even I was getting confused, so thats when I started designing the "Phones" Tab, it was worked over the top and off the blueprints if the data plans. 

The homepage Origanlly had a dropdown box, cards and the background was blue. I had this up until mid-febuary, thats when i desided it looked, "Odd", it was over-crowded, cramped and a bit too like other phone sites, the ones i looked at was Voxi, EE and Sky Mobile. My main goal was to be simillar but yet unique and diffrent. I wanted my own design, but yet still not drift too far from the idea of a Phone Website. 

I viewed the 3 websites and said "Ok, what looks bad or what could i put my own twist on?" Thats was my main startagy, it worked and didn't as many designs went through my head, on one of te concepts it was a mess, like other I previously spoke about. I knew Documentation/Comments got the most marks so mainly focued on documentation, however i could not deal with it lookingh like a mess so I quickly tidyed it up.
