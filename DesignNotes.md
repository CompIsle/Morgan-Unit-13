I Wanted to Make the webpage as appealing as posssible, by addding NavBar's, Scrollwhells and othetr familier items that the user/consumer would find on other webpgaes. 

I also added infomation about deals and offers, such as the alert at the top near the navbar, videos like the Google Pixel embeded video. I wanted to combine familiarity and original new infomation, the reason I added deals and offers was to hook the person in and saying, "Oh a Deal, well i moght have a look." It's a marketing technique of deals/offers.
It was a challange making a Mobile Phone site as there were many things consider, looks, ease of use, security and accsess. 





















I tested the Website on...
