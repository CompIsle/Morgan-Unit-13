# Description - Who this website is intended for 

This website is intended for a new business who wants to sell phones and data plans to consumers, the website is well designed and has a good ease of use. It is easy to navigate to maximize user engagement. It includes an embedded video and a mailing list sign-up at the bottom of the homepage, for the consumer to stay in contact with the business and get emails as soon as new product or deal goes live. There is a carousel at center of the homepage as that is to promote a new product thats either just come out or coming out to grab the customers attention and hook them in to buying the latest and greatest product. 


# Test Plan

- I Plan to test this website on multiple browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
- I will test it by clicking on all the components, buttons, tabs, ect
- I plan to test the FPS (Frames Per Second) and loading times of each website 
-  Plan to test each component of the code (HTML, Bootstrap & CSS), and wil try and resolve any issues if they come up.

# Justification


- I Made the use of HTML as it can be ran on most browsers such as Chrome, Firefox and Edge and many more. I has a wide range of features and it can be linked to CSS, Bootstrap ect.
- I Made the use of Bootstrap and it has some valued asset/components that can make a webpage stand out with all of its features and its wide range of compatibility with web browsers.
- I made the use of cards to show of the phones as it can give a description as well as show the product in a condensed space so that the viewer/user can easily see everything they need to know about the product quickly and efficiently. 
 - I used alerts as it can quickly grab the user attention, for example i used it as there was a 50% off deal for one day and i made it an opposing colour to the webpage to make it stand out.
 - A Navbar is a good feature to have as it gives quick access to features like links to other web pages, a search bar and more tools such as buttons, video links and more...
 - Embedded Video, i included a video to show consumers a l easy to understand promotional video about the product, it shows the product in the best light along with the best features. 
 - I used a mailing list to show the consumers that they can stay in contact and get updates on the best deals and newest releases. 
 - The Account creation was intended to show consumers that they can get exclusive benefits and i added "End-To-End Encryption" to give the consumer extra security and protection.
