# Description - Who this website is intended for 

This website is intended for a new business who wants to sell phones and data plans to consumers, the website is well design and has a good ease of use. It is easy to navigate to maximize user engagement. It includes an embedded video and a mailing list sign-up at the bottom of the homepage, for the consumer to stay in contact with the business and get emails as soon as new product or deal goes live. There is a carousel at center of the homepage as that is to promote a new product thats either just come out or coming out to grab the customers attention and hook them in to buying the latest and greatest product. 


# Justification

- I Made the use of Bootstrap and it has some valued asset/components that can make a webpage stand out with all of its features and its wide range of compatibility with web browsers.
- I made the use of cards to show of the phones as it can give a description as well as show the product in a condensed space so that the viewer/user can easily see everything they need to know about the product quickly
