# Justification


- I Made the use of HTML as it can be ran on most browsers such as Chrome, Firefox and Edge and many more. I has a wide range of features and it can be linked to CSS, Bootstrap ect.
- I made the use of CSS as it has useful features that can help design the webpage such as, background colour, elements and behavior of the component.
- I Made the use of Bootstrap and it has some valued asset/components that can make a webpage stand out with all of its features and its wide range of compatibility with web browsers.
- I made the use of cards to show of the phones as it can give a description as well as show the product in a condensed space so that the viewer/user can easily see everything they need to know about the product quickly and efficiently. 
 - I used alerts as it can quickly grab the user attention, for example i used it as there was a 50% off deal for one day and i made it an opposing colour to the webpage to make it stand out.
 - A Navbar is a good feature to have as it gives quick access to features like links to other web pages, a search bar and more tools such as buttons, video links and more...
 - Embedded Video, i included a video to show consumers a easy to understand promotional video about the product, it shows the product in the best light along with the best features. 
 - I used a mailing list to show the consumers that they can stay in contact and get updates on the best deals and newest releases. 
 - The Account creation was intended to show consumers that they can get exclusive benefits and i added "End-To-End Encryption" to give the consumer extra security and protection. 



# Restrictions

I had some restraints and restrictions when developing the website, such as Copyright and Trademarked content. some of the originally images i had used in developing the webpage had watermarks and copyright attached to the them therefoire i need to filter and al my images to "Creative Commons Licence" So it was free for public use however still giving credit to the original creator and copyright holder.
