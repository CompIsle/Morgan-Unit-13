# Who this website is intended for.

This website is intended for a new business who wants to sell phones and data plans to consumers, the website is well design and has a good ease of use. It is easy to navigate to maximize user engagement. It includes an embedded video and a mailing list sign-up at the bottom of the homepage, for the consumer to stay in contact with the business and get emails as soon as new product or deal goes live. There is a carousel at center of the homepage as that is to promote a new product thats either just come out or coming out to grab the customers attention and hook them in to buying the latest and greatest product.
