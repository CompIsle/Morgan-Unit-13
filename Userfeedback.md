# User Feedback & Recommendations


1) Armandas - The Website is well structured, you may need an Order Page. You could also change the font, its a bit bland and basic. The website could be a lot more vibrant and colourful. Other than that the Website is well designed and looks well thought out.

- Response - I took this feedback in with consideration, I was planing the "Order Page" however it never made it past the planning stage. The website has a white background as anything with colour was meant to stand out and grab the viewers attention but still the feedback has been considered many times.

2) Viktor - Your website could have a confirm password section, just copy and paste the "Password" and rename it to "Confirm Password", you could have an "About Us" Page by copy ad pasting the section on the homepage into it's own HTML file. The website is good and very well structured the NavBar may need some tweaking with the spacing.

- Response -  The "Confirm Password" section has now been added to the website, thank you for the valued feedback. The "About Us" page is currently under construction and will be fully different to the homepage of the site, with a  different description however we shall take that idea into consideration & the navbar spacing issue has now been resolved.
