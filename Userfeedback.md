1) Armandas - The Website is well structed, you may need an Order Page. You could also chamg ethe font, its a bit bland and basic. The webite could be a lot more vibrant and colourful. 


2) Viktor - Your website could have a confirm password section, just copy and paste the "Pasword" and rename it to "Confirm Password", you could have an "Abous Us" PAge by copy ad pasting the setion on the homepage into it's own HTML file.
